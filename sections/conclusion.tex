\section{Conclusion}
We managed to enable both OAuth 2.0 and OIDC protocols to authorize and authenticate between Django applications. We built the Providers with Django OAuth toolkit, acting as Resource Servers and Authentication Servers, one for OAuth and one for OIDC, and we managed to authenticate and authorize from the Client application. With the auth-ldap package, we added LDAP authentication functionality to the OIDC implementation of the provider using FORTH's LDAP server. Code is available \href{https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/django-oauth2-oidc-example}{here.}
