\section{Introduction}

Single Sign-on (SSO), is an authentication and authorization scheme where users can securely authorize, authenticate and gain access to multiple applications and websites by only logging in with a single username and password. In this project we use the OAuth 2.0 (OAuth) \cite{OAUTH} and OpenID Connect (OIDC) \cite{OIDC} technologies to enable SSO. With SSO we can authorize and authenticate applications and access resources in a secure and fast way. Users can be in a local or a remote database. To enable authentication with users in a remote database, we use authentication via the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) \cite{LDAP}, which is commonly deployed for accessing and maintaining data in a company/organization server.
% , can also be used for authentication.
